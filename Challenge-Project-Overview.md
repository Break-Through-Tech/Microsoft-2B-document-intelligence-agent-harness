## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
In this project, you will use enterprise documents (PDFs, Word documents, and other unstructured content) and modern AI techniques including vector embeddings, semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and AI agents to build an enterprise-ready document intelligence solution that can ingest, index, retrieve, and answer questions grounded in organizational knowledge. This will help any company address the challenge of making large volumes of unstructured information easily discoverable, trustworthy, and actionable for employees.

### Success Criteria

Success will be evaluated across several dimensions:

- Functional completeness: Documents are automatically ingested, parsed, indexed, and searchable through a conversational interface.
- Answer quality: The system retrieves relevant information and generates responses that are factually grounded in the uploaded documents.
- Citation accuracy: Every response includes references to the source document and relevant section or page, allowing users to verify the answer.
- Trustworthiness: The system appropriately indicates when sufficient information is unavailable rather than generating unsupported responses.
- User experience: Users can easily upload documents, manage the knowledge base, and interact with the system using natural language.
- System performance: Responses are returned within an acceptable time, and new or updated documents are reflected in the knowledge base after ingestion.
- Enterprise readiness: The architecture is modular, well documented, and designed so local components (LLMs, vector databases, storage) can be replaced with enterprise services without major redesign.

### Stretch Goals

_Here are some ways solution can be extended:_

- Multi-document reasoning: Answer questions that require synthesizing information across multiple documents.
- Advanced document workflows: Support summarization, document comparison, key information extraction, and action item generation.
- Agentic capabilities: Enable the agent to plan and execute multi-step document tasks rather than responding to a single query.
- Access control: Implement role-based document permissions to ensure users can only retrieve information from authorized documents.
- Evaluation framework: Develop automated benchmarks to measure retrieval quality, answer accuracy, citation quality, and hallucination rates.
- Enterprise integrations: Replace local storage with cloud services or integrate with enterprise repositories such as SharePoint or OneDrive.
- Observability and governance: Add logging, performance metrics, prompt injection detection, content safety checks, and audit trails.
- Multimodal document support: Extend the solution to process tables, images, scanned PDFs (OCR), and diagrams.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | Ingestion | Ingestion and indexing pipeline. Extract PDF/DOCX content, chunk it, retain metadata, generate embeddings, persist ChromaDB indexes, and verify repeatable indexing without duplicates. |
| October | Retrieval | Retrieval and grounded-answer pipeline. Implement top-k retrieval, evidence inspection, answer generation, citations, and refusal for insufficient evidence. Run early retrieval tests and a small Ragas baseline. |
| November | Integration | Integrated UI and final evaluation. Connect both pipelines in Streamlit, expose citations and intermediate results, compare configurations, run the complete evaluation set, fix weaknesses, and prepare the final demonstration and documentation. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📊 Dataset
**Name and Source:** Northstar University Knowledge Base  
**Format:** PDF, DOCX, TXT  
**Size:** under 1gb  
**Location:** data folder  

Team will use the Northstar University Knowledge Base, a fully synthetic collection of university policies and student-service documents created specifically for this project. All institutions, people, programs, contact details, and policies in the dataset are fictional; the corpus contains no personal or confidential information.

**The dataset contains**   
10 documents totaling 50 pages   
7 searchable PDF files and 3 DOCX files   
Approximately 5,200 words of extracted text   
9 current documents and 1 superseded policy   

**The documents cover**  
Academic integrity and use of generative AI  
Examinations, grading, and academic standing  
Admissions and enrollment  
Attendance and course participation  
Scholarships and financial aid  
Internships  
Library services  
Laboratory safety  
Student and campus services
